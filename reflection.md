- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My initial impression of Inheritance and how it works is awesome!!! It comes in handy especially when you are creating classes that have the same attributes. It is a work smarter not harder mindset and I love it.
Putting off this assignment for a few weeks definitly did not work. I was having trouble actually sitting down and doing it. Once I sat down and made myself do it and just started this assignment went fairly easy and very quickly. Often times I have trouble with the just starting. Thats why I would recommend someone taking this course to start everything early! Dont wait for the last minute or even past due like me!
